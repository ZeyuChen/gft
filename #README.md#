# gft (general fine-tuning): A Little Language for Deepnets

1-line programs for fine-tuning, inference and more

See <a href="doc/sections/installation.md">here</a></li> for installation.

See <a href="doc/README.md">here</a></li> for documentation.


<h1>Four Functions and Four Arguments</h1>

<i>gft</i> contains 4 main functions:
<ol>
<li><a href="doc/sections/functions/gft_fit.md">gft_fit</a>: fit a pretrained model to data (aka <i>fine-tuning</i>)</li>
<li><a href="doc/sections/functions/gft_predict.md">gft_predict</a>: apply a model to inputs (aka <i>inference</i>)</li>
<li><a href="doc/sections/functions/gft_eval.md">gft_eval</a>: score a model on a split of a dataset</li>
<li><a href="doc/sections/functions/gft_summary.md">gft_summary</a>: Find good stuff (popular models and datasets), and explain what's in those models and datasets.</li>
</ol>

These <i>gft</i> functions make use of 4 main arguments (though most arguments in most hubs are also supported):

<ol>
<li><a href="doc/sections/arguments/data.md">data</a>: standard datasets hosted on hubs such as HuggingFace, PaddleNLP, or custom datasets hosted on the local filesystem </li>
<li><a href="doc/sections/arguments/model.md">model</a>: standard models hosted on hubs such as HuggingFace, PaddleNLP, or custom models hosted on the local filesystem </li>
<li><a href="doc/sections/arguments/eqn.md">equation</a>: string such as "classify: label ~ text", where classify is a task, and label and text refer to columns in a dataset </li>
<li><a href="doc/sections/arguments/task.md">task</a>: classify, classify_tokens, classify_spans, classify_audio, classify_images, regress, text-generation, translation, ASR, fill-mask</li>
</ol>

<h1>A Few Simple Examples</h1>

Here are some simple examples:

```sh
emodel=H:bhadresh-savani/roberta-base-emotion

# Summarize a dataset and/or model
gft_summary --data H:emotion
gft_summary --model $emodel
gft_summary --data H:emotion --model $emodel

# find some popular datasets and models that contain "emotion"
gft_summary --data H:__contains__emotion --topn 5
gft_summary --model H:__contains__emotion --topn 5

# make predictions on inputs from stdin
echo 'I love you.' | gft_predict --task classify

# The default model (for the classification task) performs sentiment analysis
# The model, $emodel, outputs emotion classes (as opposed to POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)
echo 'I love you.' | gft_predict --task classify --model $emodel

# some other tasks (beyond classification)
echo 'I love New York.' | gft_predict --task H:token-classification
echo 'I <mask> you.' | gft_predict --task H:fill-mask

# make predictions on inputs from a split of a standard dataset
gft_predict --eqn 'classify: label ~ text' --model $emodel --data H:emotion --split test

# return a single score (as opposed to a prediction for each input)
gft_eval --eqn 'classify: label ~ text' --model $emodel --data H:emotion --split test

# Input a pre-trained model (bert) and output a post-trained model
gft_fit --eqn 'classify: label ~ text' \
	--model H:bert-base-cased \
	--data H:emotion \
	--output_dir $outdir
```

<h1> Pre-Training, Fine-Tuning and Inference </h1>

The table below shows a 3-step recipe, which has become standard in the literature on deep nets.


<table>
<tr> <th> <b>Step</b> </th> 
     <th> <b>gft Support</b> </th> 
     <th> <b>Description</b> </th>
     <th> <b>Time</b>  </th>
     <th> <b>Hardware</b> </th> 
</tr>

<tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Pre-Training </td> <td> Days/Weeks </td> <td> Large GPU Cluster </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> <i>gft_fit</i> </td> <td> Fine-Tuning </td> <td> Hours/Days </td> <td> 1+ GPUs </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 3 </td> <td> <i>gft_predict</i> </td> <td> Inference </td> <td> Seconds/Minutes </td> <td> 0+ GPUs </td> </tr>
</table>

This repo provides support for step 2 (<i>gft_fit</i>) and step 3
(<i>gft_predict</i>).  Most <i>gft_fit</i> and <i>gft_predict</i>
programs are short (1-line), much shorter than examples such as <a
href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples">these</a>,
which are typically a few hundred lines of python.  With <i>gft</i>, users should not need to read or modify any python
code for steps 2 and 3 in the table above.

Step 1, pre-training, is beyond the scope of this work.  We recommend
starting with models from HuggingFace and PaddleHub/PaddleNLP hubs, as
illustrated in the examples below.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
